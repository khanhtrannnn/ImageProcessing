**Topic 4: Thinning**
=====================================
- Thinning is a data reduction process that deletes the dark points along the edges of object until it has **1-pixel-wide.**
- Thinning is used to produce **skeleton** of the object. By looking at these skeletons, a recognition system can recognize object easily.

**Requirement**
=====================================
- Study Dan.S Bloomberg's algorithm to perform thinning on **scanned document images**.
- Justify the choice of dataset and techniques to experiment the studied method.
